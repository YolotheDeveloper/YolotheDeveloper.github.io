    ### CPSC 120

    * Lab 3, Part 2

        Lab 3 part 2 is my favorite because it gave me an insight of how input and 
        output works when combined. It also gave me some thought about the julian date in which is calculated to find the number of days from my current day.
    ```

    * Lab 5, Part 2

        lab 5 part 2 is also my favorite because it uses the different files in which does different purpose, in which i like due to its efficiency and organzation. It taught me to use different files to conduct coding with organization.

    * Lab 8, Part 1

        I also like lab 8 part 2 because it uses a combinatino of inputs, vectors, and series of mathematic processes, in which gave me a challenge I can remember. It also gives me future ideas on how average calculation must work.
